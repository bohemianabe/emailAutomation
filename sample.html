      Hi! &#128075; I just wanted to follow up.
    </h2>
    <p style="color: rgb(32, 32, 32)">
      I applied to your vacant position earlier this month on: {date}, and
      wanted to express my genuine interest in the position, and to speak
      further with you about possibly working together.
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(32, 32, 32)">
      I understand that during this unprecedent time you probably have a lot of
      candidates to consider, and I'm only reaching out again because I'm
      confident that your organization is a great place to work at, and that I
      can bring the talents your <b>web development team</b> is looking for.
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgb(32, 32, 32)">
      Enjoy the rest of the week, and I hope to hear from you soon.
